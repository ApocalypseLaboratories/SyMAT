SyMAT Open Source License

Source code can be used for any purpose, as long as:
 - Compiled binaries are rebranded and "SyMAT" is not
   visible by the end user at any time, except to give
   credit to Apocalypse Laboratories, such as by showing
   "Based on SyMAT by Apocalypse Laboratories" or a
   similar notice;
 - You do not use the code for evil;
 - Rebranded compiled applications have significant
   differences in functionality;
 - and you provide your modified source code for download,
   under the terms of the GNU LGPL v3 or a comparable
   license.

Compiled binaries cannot be redistributed or mirrored,
unless:
 - You have written permission from Apocalypse Laboratories;
 - Downloads are not available from Apocalypse Laboratories,
   not even behind a paywall or other blocking mechanism;
 - or you have received a multi-computer license, in which
   case you should take measures to prevent unauthorized
   downloads, such as preventing download access from the 
   Internet.
