        <h1>Graphing</h1>
        <p>You can open a standalone graph window from the ribbon bar.  
            You can also use a graph from a script or shell, for example, 
            the command plot("sin[x]").</p>
        <p>To graph a function, it must be in the form y=(something x).  
            Only input the right-hand side of the equation.</p>
        <p><i>Tip: You can export graphs as images for presentations and the like.</i></p>
