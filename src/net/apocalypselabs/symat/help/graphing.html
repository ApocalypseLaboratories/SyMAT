        <h1>Graphing</h1>
        <p>You can open a graph window with its button.  
            You can also start it with s function to graph with 
            the command plot("sin[x]") or whatever.</p>
        <p>Pretty much, if you want to graph "y=32*x", enter "32*x".</p>
        <p><i>Protip: You can save your cool graphs as a 
                picture without using a camera, check it out!</i></p>
