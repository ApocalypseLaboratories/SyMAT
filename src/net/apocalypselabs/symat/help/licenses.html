Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
*                                                                      *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)

The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

            As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>
            General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>
            General Public License.<br>
            <br>
            "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>
            other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br>
            <br>
            An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>
            by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>
            Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>
            of using an interface provided by the Library.<br>
            <br>
            A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>
            Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>
            with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked<br>
            Version".<br>
            <br>
            The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the<br>
            Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>
            for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>
            based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br>
            <br>
            The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the<br>
            object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>
            and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>
            Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br>
            <br>
            1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
            <br>
            You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>
            without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br>
            <br>
            2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br>
            <br>
            If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>
            facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>
            that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>
            facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>
            version:<br>
            <br>
            a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>
            ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>
            function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br>
            <br>
            b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>
            this License applicable to that copy.<br>
            <br>
            3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br>
            <br>
            The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>
            a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>
            code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>
            material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>
            layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>
            (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br>
            <br>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>
            Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
            covered by this License.<br>
            <br>
            b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
            document.<br>
            <br>
            4. Combined Works.<br>
            <br>
            You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>
            taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>
            portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>
            engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>
            the following:<br>
            <br>
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>
            covered by this License.<br>
            <br>
            b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>
            document.<br>
            <br>
            c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>
            these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>
            copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br>
            <br>
            d) Do one of the following:<br>
            <br>
            0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>
            License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>
            suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>
            recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>
            the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>
            manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>
            Corresponding Source.<br>
            <br>
            1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>
            Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>
            a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer<br>
            system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>
            of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>
            Version.<br>
            <br>
            e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>
            GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>
            necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>
            Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>
            Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>
            you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>
            the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>
            Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>
            Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>
            for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br>
            <br>
            5. Combined Libraries.<br>
            <br>
            You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>
            Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>
            facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>
            License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>
            choice, if you do both of the following:<br>
            <br>
            a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>
            on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>
            conveyed under the terms of this License.<br>
            <br>
            b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>
            is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>
            accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br>
            <br>
            6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br>
            <br>
            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
            of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>
            versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>
            differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br>
            <br>
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>
            Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>
            of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"<br>
            applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
            conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>
            published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>
            received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>
            General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>
            General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
            <br>
            If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>
            whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>
            apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>
            permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>
            Library.<br>
        </p><br>
        <p><b>GPL (inclusion required by LGPL)</b></p>
        <p>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
            Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
            <br>
            Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/ <br>
            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
            <br>
            Preamble<br>
            <br>
            The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
            software and other kinds of works.<br>
            <br>
            The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
            to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
            the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
            share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
            software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
            GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
            any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
            your programs, too.<br>
            <br>
            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
            price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
            have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
            them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
            want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
            free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
            <br>
            To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
            these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
            certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
            you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
            <br>
            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
            gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
            freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
            or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
            know their rights.<br>
            <br>
            Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
            (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
            giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
            <br>
            For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
            that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
            authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
            changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
            authors of previous versions.<br>
            <br>
            Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
            modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
            can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
            protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
            pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
            use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
            have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
            products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
            stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
            of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
            States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
            software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
            avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
            make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
            patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
            <br>
            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
            modification follow.<br>
            <br>
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
            <br>
            0. Definitions.<br>
            <br>
            "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
            <br>
            "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
            works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
            <br>
            "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
            License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
            "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
            <br>
            To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
            in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
            exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
            earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
            <br>
            A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
            on the Program.<br>
            <br>
            To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
            computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
            distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
            public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
            <br>
            To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
            parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
            a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
            <br>
            An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
            to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
            feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
            tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
            extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
            work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
            the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
            menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
            <br>
            1. Source Code.<br>
            <br>
            The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
            for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
            form of a work.<br>
            <br>
            A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
            standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
            interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
            is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
            <br>
            The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
            than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
            packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
            Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
            Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
            implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
            "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
            (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
            (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
            <br>
            The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
            the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
            work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
            control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
            System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
            programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
            which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
            includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
            the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
            linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
            such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
            subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
            <br>
            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
            can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
            Source.<br>
            <br>
            The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
            same work.<br>
            <br>
            2. Basic Permissions.<br>
            <br>
            All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
            copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
            conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
            permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
            covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
            content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
            rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
            <br>
            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
            convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
            in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
            of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
            with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
            the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
            not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
            for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
            and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
            your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
            <br>
            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
            the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
            makes it unnecessary.<br>
            <br>
            3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
            <br>
            No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
            measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
            11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
            similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
            measures.<br>
            <br>
            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
            circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
            is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
            the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
            modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
            users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
            technological measures.<br>
            <br>
            4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
            <br>
            You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
            receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
            appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
            keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
            non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
            keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
            recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
            <br>
            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
            and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
            <br>
            5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
            <br>
            You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
            produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
            terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
            <br>
            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
            it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
            <br>
            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
            released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
            7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
            "keep intact all notices".<br>
            <br>
            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
            License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
            License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
            regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
            <br>
            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
            work need not make them do so.<br>
            <br>
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
            and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
            in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
            "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
            used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
            beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
            in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
            parts of the aggregate.<br>
            <br>
            6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
            <br>
            You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
            of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
            machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
            in one of these ways:<br>
            <br>
            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
            customarily used for software interchange.<br>
            <br>
            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
            long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
            model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
            copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
            medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
            more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
            conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
            <br>
            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
            alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
            only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
            with subsection 6b.<br>
            <br>
            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
            place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
            further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
            Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
            that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
            clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
            Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
            <br>
            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
            Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
            charge under subsection 6d.<br>
            <br>
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
            from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
            included in conveying the object code work.<br>
            <br>
            A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
            tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
            or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
            into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
            doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
            product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
            typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
            of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
            actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
            is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
            commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
            the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
            <br>
            "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
            procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
            and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
            a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
            suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
            code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
            modification has been made.<br>
            <br>
            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
            specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
            part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
            User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
            fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
            Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
            by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
            if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
            modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
            been installed in ROM).<br>
            <br>
            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
            requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
            for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
            the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
            network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
            adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
            protocols for communication across the network.<br>
            <br>
            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
            in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
            documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
            source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
            unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
            <br>
            7. Additional Terms.<br>
            <br>
            "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
            License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
            Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
            be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
            that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
            apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
            under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
            this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
            <br>
            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
            it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
            <br>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
            add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
            that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
            <br>
            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
            <br>
            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
            Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
            <br>
            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
            <br>
            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
            authors of the material; or<br>
            <br>
            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
            trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
            <br>
            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
            it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
            any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
            those licensors and authors.<br>
            <br>
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
            restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
            received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
            governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
            restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
            a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
            License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
            of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
            not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
            <br>
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
            must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
            additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
            where to find the applicable terms.<br>
            <br>
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
            form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
            the above requirements apply either way.<br>
            <br>
            8. Termination.<br>
            <br>
            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
            provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
            modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
            this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
            paragraph of section 11).<br>
            <br>
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
            finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
            holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
            prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
            <br>
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
            copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
            your receipt of the notice.<br>
            <br>
            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
            this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
            reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
            material under section 10.<br>
            <br>
            9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
            <br>
            You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
            run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
            modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
            not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
            covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
            <br>
            10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
            <br>
            Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
            receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
            propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
            for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
            <br>
            An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
            organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
            organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
            work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
            transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
            licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
            give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
            Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
            the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
            <br>
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
            rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
            (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
            any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
            sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
            <br>
            11. Patents.<br>
            <br>
            A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
            License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
            work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
            <br>
            A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
            owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
            hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
            by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
            but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
            consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
            purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
            patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
            this License.<br>
            <br>
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
            patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
            make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
            propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
            <br>
            In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
            agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
            (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
            sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
            party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
            patent against the party.<br>
            <br>
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
            publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
            then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
            available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
            patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
            consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
            license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
            actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
            covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
            in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
            country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
            <br>
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
            covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
            receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
            or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
            you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
            work and works based on it.<br>
            <br>
            A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
            the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
            conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
            specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
            work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
            in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
            to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
            parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
            patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
            conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
            for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
            contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
            or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
            <br>
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
            any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
            otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
            <br>
            12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
            <br>
            If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
            otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
            excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
            covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
            License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
            not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
            to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
            the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
            License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
            <br>
            13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
            <br>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
            permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
            under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
            combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
            License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
            but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
            section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
            combination as such.<br>
            <br>
            14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
            <br>
            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
            the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
            be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
            address new problems or concerns.<br>
            <br>
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
            Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
            option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
            version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
            Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
            GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
            by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
            <br>
            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
            public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
            to choose that version for the Program.<br>
            <br>
            Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
            permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
            author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
            later version.<br>
            <br>
            15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
            <br>
            THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
            APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
            HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
            OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
            THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
            PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
            IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
            ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
            <br>
            16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
            <br>
            IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
            WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
            THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
            GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
            USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
            DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
            PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
            EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
            SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
            <br>
            17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
            <br>
            If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
            above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
            reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
            an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
            Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
            copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
            <br>
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
            <br>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
            <br>
            If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
            possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
            free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
            <br>
            To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
            to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
            state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
            the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
            <br>
            (one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.)<br>
            Copyright (C) (year)  (name of author)<br>
            <br>
            This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
            the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
            (at your option) any later version.<br>
            <br>
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
            GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
            <br>
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
            along with this program.  If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ .<br>
            <br>
            Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
            <br>
            If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
            notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
            <br>
            (program)  Copyright (C) (year)  (name of author)<br>
            This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
            <br>
            The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
            parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
            might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
            <br>
            You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
            if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
            For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>

            <br>
            The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
            into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
            may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
            the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
            Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

            UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0<br>
            -------------------------------<br>
            <br>
            PREAMBLE<br>
            This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
            redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
            bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
            are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
            any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
            licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
            derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
            purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
            the fonts.
            <br>
            DEFINITIONS<br>
            "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
            Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
            include source files, build scripts and documentation.
            <br>
            "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
            as received under this licence.
            <br>
            "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
            or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
            Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
            a new environment.
            <br>
            "Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
            copyright ownership of the Font Software.
            <br>
            "Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
            identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
            Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
            <br>
            To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
            permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
            infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
            computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
            distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
            a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
            countries other activities as well.
            <br>
            PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>
            This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
            rights are reserved.
            <br>
            Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
            copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
            the below conditions:
            <br>
            1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
            notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
            text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
            readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
            fields can be easily viewed by the user.
            <br>
            2) The font name complies with the following:
            (a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
            (b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
            avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
            (c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
            renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
            additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
            Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
            the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
            the new work, appended to that name.
            <br>
            3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
            Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
            Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
            acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
            their explicit written permission.
            <br>
            4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
            be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
            under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
            licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
            except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
            created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
            licence.
            <br>
            TERMINATION<br>
            This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
            not met.
            <br>
            DISCLAIMER<br>
            THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
            EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF

            COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
            INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
            DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
            FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER
            DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
